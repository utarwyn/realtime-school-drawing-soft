### What's the software consists on?

With this tool, you can start a server and few clients (on another devices if you want).
When all clients are connected to the server, each person can draw with everybody to share their drawing skills! :smiley:
A chat tool is also provided to speak with others. That's cool, no?

The tool needs Java v**1.8+** for working correctly.

### A screenshot maybe?
